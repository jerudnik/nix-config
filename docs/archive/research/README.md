### `mcp-config-research.md`
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Research multi-tool MCP configuration system for unified server definitions

**Research Questions:**
- Can we define MCP servers once and deploy to multiple AI tools?
- What configuration formats do different tools use?
- What are the tradeoffs of different approaches?

**Key Findings:**
- Claude Desktop and claude-code can share configuration (same JSON format)
- gemini-cli uses different format (array vs object)
- Shared config file approach works for Claude ecosystem
- Per-tool configs needed for tool-specific differences

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Decided to use shared `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude tools
- Prepared for per-tool configs if adding gemini-cli
- Informed the architecture in `home.nix`

**Current Documentation:** `docs/mcp.md` includes this context in integration section.

### `mcp-servers-nix-evaluation.md`
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Evaluate mcp-servers-nix as replacement for custom MCP implementation

**Research Questions:**
- Does mcp-servers-nix meet our needs?
- How does it compare to custom implementation?
- What's the migration path?
- What are the tradeoffs?

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Provides everything we envisioned (and more)
- ✅ 30+ pre-packaged MCP servers
- ✅ Multi-tool support built-in
- ✅ Secure secrets handling
- ✅ Actively maintained upstream
- ✅ Better implementation than custom approach

**Decision Matrix:**
| Criteria | Custom | mcp-servers-nix | Winner |
|----------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Maintenance | We own it | Upstream | mcp-servers-nix |
| Features | Limited | 30+ servers | mcp-servers-nix |
| Multi-tool | Build it | Built-in | mcp-servers-nix |
| Security | Manual | Built-in | mcp-servers-nix |
| Updates | Manual | Automatic | mcp-servers-nix |

**Impact on Implementation:**
- **Decision:** Adopt mcp-servers-nix
- **Action:** Replaced custom `modules/home/mcp/` implementation
- **Result:** ~550 lines of custom code eliminated
- **Outcome:** Production-ready MCP integration

**Migration Details:** See `migrations/mcp/mcp-migration-complete.md`

**Current Documentation:** `docs/mcp.md` includes migration history section.

## Research Methodology

Both documents demonstrate a structured research approach:

1. **Define Questions** - What do we need to know?
2. **Gather Information** - Official docs, community resources, source code
3. **Analyze Options** - Compare approaches with criteria matrix
4. **Document Findings** - Clear conclusions with rationale
5. **Guide Implementation** - Actionable recommendations

## Outcome

Both research efforts led to successful implementations:

- **MCP Config Research** → Informed multi-tool configuration architecture
- **mcp-servers-nix Evaluation** → Led to adoption and successful migration

Research findings are now incorporated into active documentation:
- **`docs/mcp.md`** - Current MCP integration guide with historical context
- **`docs/ai-tools.md`** - AI tools architecture informed by these findings

## When to Reference

Consult these research documents when:

- Evaluating similar architectural decisions
- Understanding why mcp-servers-nix was chosen
- Considering alternative MCP implementations
- Adding support for additional AI tools (gemini-cli, VS Code, etc.)
