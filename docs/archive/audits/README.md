- system-settings organization not documented in WARP.md
- Obsolete system-settings documentation needed archival

**Resolution:** All critical findings addressed in Priority 1 documentation updates.

### `warp-compliance-audit.md`
**Date:** October 2025  
**Purpose:** WARP.md law compliance verification across all modules

- Custom modules for nixpkgs programs (claude-code, gemini-cli)
- Orphaned code in multiple locations
- Documentation consolidation needed

**Resolution:** All violations resolved, documented in `COMPLIANCE-SUMMARY.md`.

### `mcp-ai-structure-analysis.md`
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Structural analysis of MCP and AI module integration

**Key Findings:**
- MCP configuration duplicated across multiple modules
- tools.nix orphaned and unused
- Redundant MCP logic in claude-desktop.nix

**Resolution:** Migrated to mcp-servers-nix, documented in `docs/mcp.md`.

### `ai-module-structure-analysis.md`
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** AI module organization review and optimization analysis

**Key Findings:**
- 265-line tools.nix file never imported
- 36-45% code reduction potential
- Clear separation of concerns needed

**Resolution:** Module structure cleaned up, detailed in `migrations/ai-module/`.

### `preference-domain-audit.md`
